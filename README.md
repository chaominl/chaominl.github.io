## About me
I am a third year PhD student at University of California-Irvine advised by [Zhiqin Lu](https://www.math.uci.edu/~zlu/) and [Xiangwen Zhang](https://www.math.uci.edu/~xiangwen/). My research interests are in Complex Geometry and Differential Geometry, right now particularly in J-flow and Bedford-Taylor Theory.
