* [Class of Curvature Equations, Convexity, and Real Algebraic Geometry](https://github.com/chaominl/chaominl.github.io/raw/master/thesis.pdf). My UCI Ph.D. thesis, a generalization of my previous works. The goal is to build a fundamental theory of general sigma_k equations and general inverse sigma_k equations, which show up in many fields. I am very proud of constructing this theory.
