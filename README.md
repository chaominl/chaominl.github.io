## About me
I am a Zassenhaus Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.osu.edu) at the Ohio State University under the mentorship of [Bo Guan](https://people.math.osu.edu/guan.19/). My research interests are in Complex Geometry, Differential Geometry, Geometric Analysis, and Real Algebraic Geometry. I received my Ph.D. in the Department of Mathematics at University of California-Irvine in June 2023 advised by [Zhiqin Lu](https://www.math.uci.edu/~zlu/) and [Xiangwen Zhang](https://www.math.uci.edu/~xiangwen/).
